Household leaks can waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water annually nationwide, so each year we hunt down the drips during Fix a Leak Week. Mark your calendars for EPA's annual Fix a Leak Week, March 18 through 24, 2024 —but remember that you can find and fix leaks inside and outside your home to save valuable water and money all year long.  From family fun runs to leak detection contests to WaterSense demonstrations, Fix a Leak Week events happen from coast to coast and are all geared to teach you how to find and fix household leaks. See our Event map (#Events) at the bottom of this page to find events near you and view past events!  Learn how to find and fix leaks during Fix a Leak Week. It's as easy as 1-2-3.

(#Leaks%20Still%20Flowing?)  Partner Events (#Events)  Checking for Leaks     The average household's leaks can account for nearly 10,000 gallons of water wasted every year and ten percent of homes have leaks that waste 90 gallons or more per day. Common types of leaks found in the home are worn toilet flappers, dripping faucets, and other leaking valves. These types of leaks are often easy to fix, requiring only a few tools and hardware that can pay for themselves in water savings. Fixing easily corrected household water leaks can save homeowners about 10 percent on their water bills.  To check for leaks in your home, you first need to determine whether you're wasting water and then identify the source of the leak. Here are some tips for finding leaks:  Take a look at your water usage during a colder month, such as January or February. If a family of four exceeds 12,000 gallons per month, there are serious leaks.  Check your water meter before and after a two-hour period when no water is being used. If the meter changes at all, you probably have a leak.  Identify toilet leaks by placing a drop of food coloring in the toilet tank. If any color shows up in the bowl after 10 minutes, you have a leak. (Be sure to flush immediately after the experiment to avoid staining the tank.)  Examine faucet gaskets and pipe fittings for any water on the outside of the pipe to check for surface leaks.  Use our checklist to keep track of your search for leaks: Detect and Chase Down Leaks at Home Checklist (/sites/production/files/2017-02/documents/ws-ourwater-detect-and-chase-down-leaks-checklist.pdf)  (2 pp, 2 MB, About PDF (/home/pdf-files) ) | En Español (PDF) (/sites/production/files/2019-03/documents/ws-falw-checklist_spanish_508.pdf)  (2 pp, yy K, About PDF (/home/pdf-files) )  WaterSense partners have guides and videos that you might find helpful in finding and fixing leaks. Arizona Municipal Water User's Association has a great Smart Home Water Guide (http://www.smarthomewaterguide.org/) Exit EPA’s website .  Regional Water Providers Consortium in Oregon has a number of videos on detecting household leaks (http://www.conserveh2o.org/how-to-videos-water-conservation) Exit EPA’s website .  Thornton Water in Colorado provides tips and tricks to find hidden water waste (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn4QWwIEbf0) Exit EPA’s website indoors and outdoors.   Toilet Leaks  Old or worn-out toilet flappers (e.g., valve seal) can cause leaks. This simple rubber device holds water in the tank, then releases water into the bowl when the toilet is flushed. Because the rubber can wear out, the flapper should be checked periodically and replaced at least every five years to ensure  a good seal and avoid leaks. An old or worn flapper can cause your toilet to flush on its own or silently leak thousands of gallons a year. Replacing a flapper is a quick and easy fix that will save water and money. If you need more help, you can also consult your local hardware store, home improvement, retailer, or a licensed plumber.  Here are some online resources from WaterSense partners:  WaterSense Bath Hack #3 shows how easy it is to Replace Your Leaky Toilet Flapper (https://youtu.be/TPeViXIgOPE) Exit EPA’s website .  Moulton Niguel Water District in California has a great series of \"Potty Talk\" videos (https://www.mnwd.com/fix-a-leak/) Exit EPA’s website that walk through everything you need to know about finding and fixing toilet leaks.

(https://www.regionalh2o.org/file/fixing-toilet-leak) Exit EPA’s website  Two major manufacturers of flappers also have websites that can help you diagnose problems and find the right flapper to fit your needs: Korky's Toilet Troubleshooting Guide (https://www.korky.com/toilet-help/troubleshooting-guide) Exit EPA’s website and Fluidmaster's Toilet Repair Guide (https://www.fluidmaster.com/toilet-problems/) Exit EPA’s website .  Tip: Bring the old flapper (or a picture of it) to the hardware store to make sure you buy a new flapper that fits your toilet model. Pay attention to the width of the flapper and whether it has a foam float on it that may also need to be replaced. You can also check the owner's manual, if you have it, or the manufacturer's website for information on replacement parts.  Faucet Leaks    Old and worn faucet washers and gaskets frequently cause leaks in faucets. A leaky faucet that drips at the rate of one drip per second can waste more than 3,000 gallons per year. That's the amount of water needed to take more than 180 showers! Many tutorials are available online for how to fix a wide variety of faucets. Here are a few examples from our partners:  AWWA's Drip Calculator (https://drinktap.org/Water-Info/Water-Conservation/Drip-Calculator) Exit EPA’s website helps you see how drips add up to gallons wasted.

Showerhead Leaks  A showerhead leaking at 10 drips per minute wastes more than 500 gallons per year. That's the amount of water it takes to wash 60 loads of dishes in your dishwasher. Some leaky showerheads can be fixed by making sure there is a tight connection between the showerhead and the pipe stem and by using pipe tape to secure it. Pipe tape, also called Teflon tape, is available at most hardware stores, is easy to apply, and can help control leaks. For more complicated valve leaks in showers that drip when not in use, contact an experienced handyperson or licensed plumber.  This WaterSense Showerhead Bath Hack #1 video (https://youtu.be/5osCKFzSbxI) Exit EPA’s website shows how easy it is to add teflon tape and replace your showerhead.  Tip: It's also a good idea to check and, if needed, replace the washer or \"o\" ring inside the showerhead while making this repair.  Outdoor Leaks  If you have an in-ground irrigation system, check it each spring before use to make sure it wasn’t damaged by frost or freezing. An irrigation system that has a leak 1/32nd of an inch in diameter (about the thickness of a dime) can waste about 6,300 gallons of water per month. If you need help, hire an irrigation professional certified by a WaterSense labeled program (/water-sense/irrigation-pro) to inspect it for you. These professionals have passed a certification program focused on water efficiency. They will not only help you detect and correct leaks in the system, but also maximize its efficiency.

Tip: Don't forget garden hoses!  Check your garden hose for leaks at its connection to the spigot. If it leaks while you run your hose, replace the nylon or rubber hose washer and ensure a tight connection to the spigot using pipe tape and a wrench.   In the Workplace  Leaks don’t just happen at home. You should be on the lookout for leaks even when you are at work. Here are some ways to help find and fix leaks in your workplace.  If you see a leak–in the restroom, pantry, or outdoors–report it to your maintenance staff.  Organize a Fix a Leak Week event in your facility to challenge employees and tenants to find leaks and report water waste. You may even be able to get your local water utility to help.  Post signs in restrooms and pantries to encourage everyone to look for leaks and report problems. Include information on who they should contact. WaterSense developed some graphic tools you can use to communicate with employees on the need to report leaks.

(#Leaks%20Still%20Flowing?)  Partner Events (#Events)  Checking for Leaks     The average household\\'s leaks can account for nearly\\xa010,000 gallons of water wasted every year and ten percent of homes have leaks that waste 90 gallons or more per day. Common types of leaks found in the home are worn toilet flappers, dripping faucets, and other leaking valves. These types of leaks are often easy to fix, requiring only a few tools and hardware that can pay for themselves in water savings. Fixing easily corrected household water leaks can save homeowners about 10 percent on their water bills.  To check for leaks in your home, you first need to determine whether you\\'re wasting water and then identify the source of the leak. Here are some tips for finding leaks:  Take a look at your water usage during a colder month, such as January or February. If a family of four exceeds 12,000 gallons per month, there are serious leaks.  Check your water meter before and after a two-hour period when no water is being used. If the meter changes at all, you probably have a leak.  Identify toilet leaks by placing a drop of food coloring in the toilet tank. If any color shows up in the bowl after 10 minutes, you have a leak. (Be sure to flush immediately after the experiment to avoid staining the tank.)  Examine faucet gaskets and pipe fittings for any water on the outside of the pipe to check for surface leaks.  Use our checklist to keep track of your search for leaks: Detect and Chase Down Leaks at Home Checklist (/sites/production/files/2017-02/documents/ws-ourwater-detect-and-chase-down-leaks-checklist.pdf)  (2 pp, 2\\xa0MB, About PDF (/home/pdf-files) ) | En Español (PDF) (/sites/production/files/2019-03/documents/ws-falw-checklist_spanish_508.pdf)  (2\\xa0pp, yy K, About PDF (/home/pdf-files) )  WaterSense partners have guides and videos that you might find helpful in finding and fixing leaks.

Toilet Leaks  Old or worn-out toilet flappers (e.g., valve seal) can cause leaks. This simple rubber device holds water in the tank, then releases water into the bowl when the toilet is flushed. Because the rubber can wear out, the flapper should be checked periodically and replaced at least every five years to ensure\\xa0 a good seal and avoid leaks. An old or worn flapper can cause your toilet to flush on its own or silently leak thousands of gallons a year. Replacing a flapper is a quick and easy fix that will save water and money. If you need more help, you can also consult your local hardware store, home improvement, retailer, or a licensed plumber.\\xa0 Here are some online resources from WaterSense partners:  WaterSense Bath Hack #3 shows how easy it is to Replace Your Leaky Toilet Flapper (https://youtu.be/TPeViXIgOPE) Exit EPA’s website .

Tip: Bring the old flapper (or a picture of it) to the hardware store to make sure you buy a new flapper that fits your toilet model. Pay attention to the width of the flapper and whether it has a foam float on it that may also need to be replaced. You can also check the owner\\'s manual, if you have it, or the manufacturer\\'s website for information on replacement parts.  Faucet Leaks    Old and worn faucet washers and gaskets frequently cause leaks in faucets. A leaky faucet that drips at the rate of one drip per second can waste more than 3,000 gallons per year.

Outdoor Leaks  If you have an in-ground irrigation system, check it each spring before use to make sure it wasn’t damaged by frost or freezing. An irrigation system that has a leak 1/32nd of an inch in diameter (about the thickness of a dime) can waste about 6,300 gallons of water per month. If you need help, hire an irrigation professional certified by a WaterSense labeled program (/water-sense/irrigation-pro) to inspect it for you. These professionals have passed a certification program focused on water efficiency. They will not only help you detect and correct leaks in the system, but also maximize its efficiency.

In the Workplace  Leaks don’t just happen at home. You should be on the lookout for leaks even when you are at work. Here are some ways to help find and fix leaks in your workplace.  If you see a leak–in the restroom, pantry, or outdoors–report it to your maintenance staff.  Organize a Fix a Leak Week event in your facility to challenge employees and tenants to find leaks and report water waste. You may even be able to get your local water utility to help.  Post signs in restrooms and pantries to encourage everyone to look for leaks and report problems. Include information on who they should contact.\\xa0WaterSense\\xa0developed some graphic tools you can use to communicate with employees on the need to report leaks.
